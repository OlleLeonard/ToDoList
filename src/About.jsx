        <p className="List">A list is a set of discrete items of information collected 
            and set forth in some format for utility, entertainment, or 
            other purposes. A list may be memorised in any number of ways, 
            including existing only in the mind of the list-maker, but lists 
            are frequently written down on paper, or maintained electronically.
            Lists are "most frequently a tool", and "one does not read but only uses a list: 
            one looks up the relevant information in it,
            but usually does not need to deal with it as a whole"
